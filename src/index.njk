        <p class="mb-6 text-xl">Immersve enables the holders of cryptocurrencies, tokens and DeFi / Game-FI earnings in NFT wallets, exchanges or various protocols to leverage their holdings for their local Fiat currency to spend at real life merchants or transact in the Metaverse with their Agents or Avatars. Immersve provides a seamless bridge between in real life and Metaverse payments through a single payment protocol. In addition, the card has the added â€˜cool' effect of users being able to forge their favourite NFT on the card, displaying their handle (not their name) and earn a configurable real time reward that are relevant to their community (such as tokens, NFT's or even Stablecoins). Immersve will pioneer at pace, features and integrations for a unified payment experience across web2 / 3 and the Metaverse. The design is one of privacy first, products and experiences will be as decentralised as practically possible with open source code, API's and multi-chain protocols enabling anyone to extend or build on top of.</p>
